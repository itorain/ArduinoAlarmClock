ArduinoAlarmClock
=================
This is a simple alarm clock project for my electrical engineering course that uses an Arduino uno R3, a 32x16 LED matrix display from seeed studio, an LED, and a piezo buzzer. Currently it is very basic but I will adding more features and abilities as time goes on. The link to the LED display is below.
